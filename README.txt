This is a snapshot version of the vertebra-segmentation project written by Python 3.5.

Databases including 10 vertebrae raw CT images and their corresponding labeled image are all ignored.
Plus, Target files like generated data are also ignored.

The framework consists of three consecutive step, 
A) initial-mesh-model
B) spacial-possibility-model
C) deformable-model
And following three steps are replaced in three different directories under the root.
